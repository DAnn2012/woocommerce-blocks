# Testing notes and ZIP for release 9.1.0

Zip file for testing: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/files/10334740/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

## load all JSON translation files correctly ([8034](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8034))

1. Switch to Dutch in your website.
2. Make sure all translation is working fine (in Shipping, summary items, and express payment).

## Disable Rate Limiting when editing Blocks in admin ([7934](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7934))

1. Enable the [rate limiting filter for Store API](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/blob/trunk/src/StoreApi/docs/rate-limiting.md). You can use the [Code Snippets plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) to add the following PHP script:

```PHP
  add_filter( 'woocommerce_store_api_rate_limit_options', function() {
	return [
		'enabled' => true, // enables/disables Rate Limiting. Default: false
		'proxy_support' => false, // enables/disables Proxy support. Default: false
		'limit' => 1, // limit of request per timeframe. Default: 25
		'seconds' => 500, // timeframe in seconds. Default: 10
	];
  } );
```

2. Create a product related page (e.g., Hand-picked Products)
3. Update the block to send some requests to the Store API. In the case of the `Hand-picked Products` block, clicking on `Edit selected products` should do the work:

4. Make sure the block is working as expected and you aren't getting any rate-limiting warnings.
5. Open your store in a new window using your browser's incognito mode. Add a product and go to the Cart Block page
6. Increase or decrease the product quantity couple of times. You can see failed rate limited request in the browser dev tools under `Network` tab, or you can reload the page to see the last saved product quantity value. See recording:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14235870/209964938-36018e19-5a0c-414a-8b8b-14683bf7617c.mov

7. Repeat step 6 with a customer role account logged in. You should get the same result from step 6.


## Ensure filter blocks are not reloaded every time they are selected in the editor ([8002](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8002))

1. Create a new post, add the following blocks: Filter by rating, filter by stock, filter by attribute, filter by price, Products (Beta), and publish it.
3. Access the post as a regular customer would. Ensure nothing has changed, and all filters are working as expected.
4. Now edit the post: ensure all components are normally loaded in the editor. When you click on them, ensure that you see the same behavior as demonstrated on [this gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15730971/208894840-5fed09d6-2c5c-4da2-9ee3-370068709309.gif) shared earlier on this PR (no preloaders should be displayed).

## Product Query: create variation of core/post-template as a Product Query inner block ([7838](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7838))

1. Add a Product Query block.
2. Ensure that the “Product Template” block shows up in the tree view instead of the “Post Template”.

## Highlight incompatible payment gateways ([7412](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7412))

**Highlight incompatible payment gateways using a sidebar notice**

1. Add incompatible payment gateways with the C&C Blocks (e.g., Paypal, Klarna Payments). You will need to configure them to be detected and used by WooCommerce.
2. Create a new page and add the `Checkout Block`
3. Verify there is a notice in the sidebar displaying the list of incompatible gateways. The `make as default` & `sidebar compatibility` notices should be hidden while the `incompatible gateways` notice is displayed.

<img width="1295" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14235870/209318806-4d3b0e16-bb97-4a51-8818-3529b0559be4.png">

4. Select each inner block in the Checkout Blocks' `List View` to ensure our notice is displayed for each one.
5. Dismiss the `incompatible gateways` notice by clicking the top right `X` button. The `make as default` & `sidebar compatibility` notices should be visible again.

6. Do the same test from step 2 to 5 using the `Cart Block`

**Highlight incompatible payment gateways within the `Payment Options Block`**

1. If it's not done already, add incompatible payment gateways with the C&C Blocks (e.g., Paypal, Klarna Payments)
2. Create a new page and add the `Checkout Block`
3. Select the `Payment Options Block`, and check the list of available payment gateways under `Methods` in the sidebar. The incompatible payment gateways should be highlighted (i.e., `Incompatible with block-based checkout`)

```

## Remove opinionated styles from Button component on TT3 and Zaino themes ([7992](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7992))

**Preparation:**

Create three posts, one with the Mini Cart block, another one with the Cart block and the last one with the Checkout block.

**Test different themes:**

1. Twenty Twenty Three:
    1.1. Install it from here: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/
    1.2. Go to the pages created in step 1 and verify the Mini Cart, Cart and Checkout buttons **follow** the theme styles.
    1.3. Go to Apperance > Editor > Styles > Browse Styles and change between style variations. Verify the buttons follow the styles in all of them.

2. Twenty Twenty Two (or another block theme):
    2.1. Install it from here: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/
    2.2. Go to the pages created in step 1 and verify the Mini Cart, Cart and Checkout buttons **don't follow** the theme styles. Instead, they have opinionated styles.

3. Storefront (or another classic theme):
    3.1. Install it from here: https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/
    3.2. Go to the pages created in step 1 and verify the Mini Cart, Cart and Checkout buttons **don't follow** the theme styles. Instead, they have opinionated styles.
