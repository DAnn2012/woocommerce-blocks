### Fix for Rating alignment when used in Products block ([8104](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8104))

0. Make sure you have at least one product with rating.
1. Create a post and add Products (Beta) block
2. If not yet added, add Product Rating block into the Product Template
3. Try to set each of the Rating alignment (as on a video below)
4. Expected: Starts are aligned accordingly
5. Save the post for each of the option and check the change is reflected on the frontend

### Hide `core/no-results` as default in Product Query if WP <= 5.9 ([8082](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8082))

1. Make sure you have WordPress 5.9 or lower installed in your testing instance.
2. Add a “Products (Beta)” block.
3. Make sure the block can be added and is working correctly.
4. Install a WordPress version >= to 6.0.
5. Add a new “Products (Beta)” block.
6. Make sure the block contains the core/no-results block by default.
