## Feature Plugin

### Mini Cart Contents Block: not show wc-block-mini-cart\_\_contents in additional classes section [#5984](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/5984)

1. On FSE editor, go on template parts and click on the Mini Cart.
2. Get the focus on the Mini Cart Contents block.
3. Open the block settings and check the additional classes section.
4. Check that the input is empty.

### Correctly load JS translations from WC core [#6036](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/6036)

1. Go to Settings > General > Language (/wp-admin/options-general.php) and select a language which has WC core translation at 100% but WC Blocks' at 0%. (I tested with Catal√†).
2. Go to the updates screen (/wp-admin/update-core.php), scroll down and update the language translations.
3. Visit the Cart or Checkout block in the frontend and verify all texts are translated.

### Try to memoize/cache filter results so that we don't call third party filters too often [#5143](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/5143)

These instructions use WooCommerce Subscriptions as this is known to use several filters in different places.

1. Install WooCommerce Subscriptions and create a subscription product.
2. Add it to the cart.
3. Go to the Cart block and ensure it shows the details of the subscription product under the line item.
4. Ensure you can still successfully check out and you are charged the amount you expect to be based on the item price in the database, what is displayed in the Cart block and what is displayed in the Checkout block.
